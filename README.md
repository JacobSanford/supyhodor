# SupyHodor
Supybot plugin designed for hodoring.

## Use
Listen for mentions of Hodor's name in channels and reply with a message.

Messages are pre-defined from a basic module import and classified by mood.

The 'mood' of reply is determined by comparing the content of the triggering
message against a library of words and human interpreted intent scoring. After
mood assignment, a message is chosen based on a 'item drop' type selection process
that allows for weighting of responses.

## Sources
- Mood is chosen based on a dataset 'AFINN' generated by Finn Arup Nielsen in
2009-2011 and used under the "Open Database License (ODbL) v1.0". http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010
